The goal of this task was to deploy a simple website.
"You have been asked to create a website. As a proof of concept, it will be sufficient that you demonstrate a website that displays text and an image on a single home page."

I decided to create single VM.

Requirements:

1. Deliver the tooling to set up an application that displays a web page with Lorem Ipsum text and an image

2. Provide source code for creating the stack in a publicly available repository e.g. Github (https://github.com)

3. Provide basic setup documentation to run the application

4. All resources should be deployed using Terraform

5. Automate the deployment of your application using CI/CD
